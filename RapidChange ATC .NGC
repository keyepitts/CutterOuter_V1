; M6 REMAP Macro for ATC RapidChange rack tool changer
;
; Assumptions
; 1 Toolnumber is not equal to pocket number
; 2 pocket number is the discriminating factor for pick up procedure (from rack, from manual position)
; 3 all tools need to be measured 

; Uses global numbered variable #5190  to store the pocket of the tool that gets mounted as a work around for the broken handler in linuxcnc tooltable
; Note: If #5190 is manually entered into linuxnc.var it will be stored between starts of linux, this is currently not desired.
; Uses M66 E0 (analog input 00 to obtain tool-prep-pocket from iocontrol. This is more stable than a call on #<_hal[iocontrol.0.tool-prep-pocket]> as TxM6 and Tx and M6 seperately are interpreted)

; DustCover actuation is done using a single signal pin via M64 and M65
; Coding of DustCover is done in HAl config with LUT5 logic
